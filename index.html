      Hello

    <div class="container">

      <h3>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h3>
      <div id="view1"></div>
      <p><strong>Design choice:</strong> Bar chart was chosen because it provides a clear comparison between global sales across different platforms and genres. The stacked format allows us to see which genres contribute most to the success of each platform, making it easier to interpret the dominance of platforms like Wii and PS2 in particular genres.</p>
      
      <h3>Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h3>
      <div id="view2"></div>
      <p><strong>Design choice:</strong> The stacked area chart was chosen to display cumulative sales trends over time, allowing us to see both the total growth in sales and how different platforms/genres contribute to this growth. The smooth transitions over time also help capture the dynamics of the gaming industry, making it easier to follow key platforms' growth and decline.</p>

      <h3>Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h3>
      <div id="view3"></div>
      <p><strong>Design choice:</strong> The grouped bar chart was selected to allow a clear comparison between regional sales across different platforms. Grouping the sales by platform and region makes it easier to identify regional preferences and see how specific platforms perform across different geographic markets. The addition of a legend also ensures easy identification of regions by color.</p>

      <h3>Visualization 4: Tell Us a Visual Story</h3>
      <h3>Sales trends in Japan</h3>
      <div id="view4"></div>
      <p><strong>Design choice:</strong> A bar chart was selected to highlight the comparison of genre performance in Japan versus other regions. The simplicity of the chart allows users to easily see the standout performance of RPGs and the clear contrast between genres that thrive in Japan compared to other markets.</p>
